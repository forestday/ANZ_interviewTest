I'm sorry I didn't finish the test, but I did some work. 
Not completed include JUnit test code, some configuration framework, code optimization and troubleshooting; 
I received a test topic at 11 this morning, but I was busy with work during the day, after work to the event is 8 in the evening, 
no Internet in the working environment can not access the relevant information. 
And because I did not use the GitHub, so I am not enough time. 
But this is not an excuse to complete the test, I just want to explain the situation; 
I am very concerned about this job opportunity, this test shows the problem I will correct.
